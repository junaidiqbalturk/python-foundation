#Sets
#Duplicates are not allowed in sets in Python
#if you dont want duplicate use sets, otherwise use lists
# With Sets the Order is not guaranteed
# WIth Lists the Order is guaranteed
#List can be declare using Square brackets
# Sets can be declare using Curly Brackets.

numbersList = [1,1]
numbersSet = {1, 1}
letterSet = {"A","A","B","C","C"}

print(numbersList)
print(numbersSet)
print(letterSet)  #Sets are always in order
